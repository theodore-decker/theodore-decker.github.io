## About Me

I am a fourth year student at The Pennsylvania State University with an expected graduation date of May 2019. My objective is to find a full time position involving penetration testing, information security or risk assessment. During my years at Penn State, I have been involved with: Club Water Polo; THON; Red Cell Analytics; and the Information Assurance Club.
